# ION Improvement Proposals

ION Improvement Proposals (IIPs) describe standards for the ION platform.

Having an IIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the ION users.

## Contributing

First review IIP-1. Then clone the repository and add your IIP to it. Then submit a pull request to ionomy's IIPs repository.

## IIP status terms

* **Draft** - an IIP that is open for consideration.
* **Accepted** - an IIP that is planned for immediate adoption.
* **Final** - an IIP that has already been adopted.
* **Deferred** - an IIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption, but may be reconsidered in the future.
